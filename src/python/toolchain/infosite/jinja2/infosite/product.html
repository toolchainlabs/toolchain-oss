                    Toolchain is built on <a type="external" class="primary" target="_blank" href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/" rel="noopener">Pants</a>, our ergonomic, open-source developer workflow system. This  state-of-the-art system installs, orchestrates and runs all your favorite tools, coordinating inputs and outputs as needed.

                <p class="product-row-paragraph body3">
                    Pants uses caching and concurrency to speed up your desktop and CI builds. Pants is designed for real-world needs. For example, it infers your code's dependencies automatically, so you don't have to maintain huge amounts of build metadata. And it's easy to add your own custom build steps using a Python 3 plugin API.
