        <h3>Warranties and Liability.</h3>

          YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN
          “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. THE SITE, AND ALL OTHER COMPONENTS
          OF THE SITE, ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, IMPLIED OR
          STATUTORY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, DATA SECURITY, TITLE, FITNESS
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND
          ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
          TOOLCHAIN MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (A) THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR
          REQUIREMENTS; (B) THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR
          ERROR-FREE; (C) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF SITE
          WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; OR (D) THE QUALITY OF ANY DATA,
          PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL OBTAINED BY YOU
          THROUGH THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Toolchain will not be
          liable to you under any theory of liability for any indirect,
          incidental, special, consequential, punitive, exemplary or other
          damages arising out of the Site or your use thereof, including loss of
          profits and damages for loss of goodwill, use, or data or other
          intangible losses, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
          liability, or otherwise, resulting from: (a) the use or the inability
          to use the Site; (b) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and
          services resulting from any goods, data, information, or services
          purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered
          into through or from the Site; (c) unauthorized access to or
          alteration of your transmissions or data; or (d) any other matter
          relating to the SITE. In no event will Toolchain’s total liability to
          you for all damages, losses, or causes of action related to the Site
          or any resulting data exceed one hundred dollars ($100). This
          limitation shall apply even if Toolchain was advised of, or should
          have been aware of, the possibility of such damages. Some
          jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations; in such
          jurisdictions, the exclusions and limitations stated in these Terms
          shall apply to you to the maximum extent permitted by law. Section 6
          and this Section 7 are intended to be only as broad as is permitted
          under applicable laws. If any portion of those sections are held to be
          invalid under any applicable laws, the invalidity of such portion will
          not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the applicable
          sections.

          default. These Terms represent the complete and exclusive agreement
          between you and Toolchain relating to the Site and supersede any
          previous or contemporaneous oral or written communications between you
