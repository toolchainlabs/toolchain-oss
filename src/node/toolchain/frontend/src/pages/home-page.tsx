    <h1>Welcome to Toolchain!</h1>
    <p>
      Current build tools run on your desktop, so when writing, testing and debugging code - slow, broken, and
      inconsistent builds are an immense source of frustration, interrupted flow and lost productivity.
      <br />
      <br />
      Toolchain is solving these problems by going beyond build tools and creating the first truly cloud-centric build
      system. We&apos;re bringing together the scalability, concurrency and flexibility of distributed systems, as well
      massive as amounts of data derived from static analysis of your code and millions of open-source libraries.
    </p>
