Toolchain Production Scripts
----------------------------

We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy our various services to AWS.
See [here](../../../terraform/) for details.

This directory contains a handful of useful scripts for interacting with existing AWS infrastructure.

In particular, see [BASTION.md](BASTION.md) for how to ssh to a bastion, and [DJANGO_MANAGE.md](DJANGO_MANAGE.md)
for how to run Django management commands.
