# Terraform Reusable blocks

Reusable blocks of parameterized resource configuration, known in Terraform parlance
as [modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html).

The parameters for each module are specified in a file named `variables.tf` in that module's dir.

See individual dirs and files for details.
